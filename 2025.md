### Keynote Speaker

#### Professor Gustavo Alonso

***Keynote: Vertically integrated storage systems***

##### Abstract
Storage systems are often seen as being separated from compute systems. In this talk, I will argue that storage should be vertically integrated into compute units, i.e., storage should be an integral and seamless component actively participating in the processing of data. The motivation to do so is obvious from the sheer amount of data that needs to be processed these days, not only on ML/LLM/AI applications but also in more conventional data analytics. And the concept of vertically integrating storage applies whether it is a local disk or disaggregated storage in the cloud. In fact, the performance characteristics of cloud storage has already led to pushing some amount of data processing down to the storage layer to minimize the amount of data to be transferred across the network and to compute nodes. In the talk, I will argue that these initial steps should be expanded to create a computational pipeline from storage to the compute node memory that includes active storage, smart NICs, and accelerators. While some of these ideas have been pursued in isolation and are often centered around a particular type of technology, today we have the opportunity to think about such designs end-to-end taking advantage of innovations such as CXL. In the talk I will motivate the idea, suggest ways to implement initial prototypes, and discuss its integration into software systems – often the biggest bottleneck when trying to take advantage of hardware advances.

### Invited Speakers

#### Dr. Jean-Thomas Acquaviva, DDN Storage

***Invited Talk: From HPC to AI: a data  Journey***

##### Abstract
Two technological revolutions have recently marked the storage community: the mass availability  of Flash and the rise of object-type APIs. These revolutions seem to be coming to an end, and a common architecture is emerging. Data centers tend to become more and more "data centric" with different computing services attached to a central data space. Due of this centrality, the datahub must meet five main criteria: extreme scalability, uncompromising performance, operational efficiency, 24/7 availability and ease of allocation of shared resources. To which point this architecture differ from AI and HPC? In this talk, we will discuss from an industrial standpoints the main area of convergence and differenciation depending on the dominant workload.

At DDN, Jean-Thomas' role includes overseeing research collaborations in Europe as well as product management for some advanced DDN’s solutions.

## Workshop Description

The fifth workshop on “Challenges and Opportunities of Efficient and Performant Storage Systems” (CHEOPS) is aimed at researchers, developers of scientific applications, engineers and everyone interested in the evolution of storage systems. As the developments of computing power, storage and network technologies continue to diverge, the bandwidth performance gap between them widens. This trend, combined with the ever-growing data volumes and data-driven computing such as machine learning, results in I/O and storage limitations, impacting the scalability and efficiency of current and future computing systems. Some of these challenges are quantitative, such as scale to match exascale system requirements, or latency reduction of the software stack to efficiently integrate new generations of hardware like storage class memory (SCM). Some other issues are more subtle and arise with the increased complexity of the storage solutions, like new smarter and more potent data management tools, monitoring systems or interoperability between I/O components or data formats.

The main objective of this workshop is to discuss state-of-the-art research, innovative ideas and experiences that focus on the design and implementation of storage systems in both academic and industrial worlds.

## Important Dates

- Abstract Submission: ~~Jan 10th~~ Jan 17th, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth) [Extended deadline]
- Paper Submission: ~~Jan 17th~~ Jan 24th, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth) [Extended deadline]
- Notification to Authors: ~~Feb 7th~~ Feb 14th, 2025
- Camera-Ready Deadline: Feb 28th, 2025
- Workshop Date: March 31st, 2025

## Submission Guidelines

In order to guarantee the quality of the submissions, we have formed a globally distributed, diverse program committee. All submissions will be reviewed by the program committee. We will use [HotCRP to manage the submissions](https://cheops25.hotcrp.com/). The reviewing process will be double blind with at least 3 reviews for each submission. An online discussion will determine which papers to accept.

Only original and novel work not currently under review in other venues will be considered for publication. Submissions can either be full papers (6 pages) or short papers (4 pages). The page count includes the title, text, figures, appendices but excludes the references. They must be submitted electronically as PDF files formatted according to the [submission rules of EuroSys](https://2025.eurosys.org/cfp.html). Accepted submissions will have to comply with the EuroSys proceedings format. One author of each accepted paper is required to register for the workshop and present the paper.
Extended versions of selected papers will be considered for publication in the ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review journal.

<!-- Presentations can be given either in-person or via pre-recorded videos. In the latter case, the organizers will collect questions during the presentation and perform a live Q&A session with the presenter, who should be available via video conference. -->

<!-- 
### Rights Forms

You will find a link to the ACM copyright form on your paper's [HotCRP page](https://cheops25.hotcrp.com/).
Once completed, ACM will send out the information and LaTeX directives (DOI, ISBN etc.) needed to complete the camera-ready version of your paper.
-->

### Camera-Ready Format

You should use the `acmart` document class (<https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>, the same as for submission), as follows: `\documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart}`

As mentioned above, you will receive the instruction regarding some LaTeX directives (`\setcopyright`, `\acmConference`, `\acmDOI` etc.) after completing the copyright form.

All accepted papers can use up to 2 additional pages for the camera-ready version, for a final limit of 8 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) pages, references not included.

Note that Type 1 fonts (scalable) should be used, not Type 3 (bitmapped), and that all fonts must be embedded.
Type and embedding of fonts can be checked with various tools including `pdffonts`.
Page numbers should be suppressed.
Make also sure that the PDF is searchable by testing the search function in a PDF reader.

## Information regarding the Rights forms and Uploading Final versions is coming soon. 

<!-- 
### Uploading Final Versions

The camera-ready version of your paper and its LaTeX sources have to be uploaded via [HotCRP](https://cheops25.hotcrp.com/).
As a reminder, the camera-ready deadline for all papers is Feb 28th, 2025.
-->
