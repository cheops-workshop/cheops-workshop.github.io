## Workshop Description

The fifth workshop on “Challenges and Opportunities of Efficient and Performant Storage Systems” (CHEOPS) is aimed at researchers, developers of scientific applications, engineers and everyone interested in the evolution of storage systems. As the developments of computing power, storage and network technologies continue to diverge, the bandwidth performance gap between them widens. This trend, combined with the ever-growing data volumes and data-driven computing such as machine learning, results in I/O and storage limitations, impacting the scalability and efficiency of current and future computing systems. Some of these challenges are quantitative, such as scale to match exascale system requirements, or latency reduction of the software stack to efficiently integrate new generations of hardware like storage class memory (SCM). Some other issues are more subtle and arise with the increased complexity of the storage solutions, like new smarter and more potent data management tools, monitoring systems or interoperability between I/O components or data formats.

The main objective of this workshop is to discuss state-of-the-art research, innovative ideas and experiences that focus on the design and implementation of storage systems in both academic and industrial worlds.

## Important Dates

- Abstract Submission: ~~Jan 10th~~ Jan 17th, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth) [Extended deadline]
- Paper Submission: ~~Jan 17th~~ Jan 24th, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth) [Extended deadline]
- Notification to Authors: ~~Feb 7th~~ Feb 14th, 2025
- Camera-Ready Deadline: Feb 28th, 2025
- Workshop Date: March 31st, 2025

## Submission Guidelines

In order to guarantee the quality of the submissions, we have formed a globally distributed, diverse program committee. All submissions will be reviewed by the program committee. We will use [HotCRP to manage the submissions](https://cheops25.hotcrp.com/). The reviewing process will be double blind with at least 3 reviews for each submission. An online discussion will determine which papers to accept.

Only original and novel work not currently under review in other venues will be considered for publication. Submissions can either be full papers (6 pages) or short papers (4 pages). The page count includes the title, text, figures, appendices but excludes the references. They must be submitted electronically as PDF files formatted according to the [submission rules of EuroSys](https://2025.eurosys.org/cfp.html). Accepted submissions will have to comply with the EuroSys proceedings format. One author of each accepted paper is required to register for the workshop and present the paper.
Extended versions of selected papers will be considered for publication in the ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review journal.

<!-- Presentations can be given either in-person or via pre-recorded videos. In the latter case, the organizers will collect questions during the presentation and perform a live Q&A session with the presenter, who should be available via video conference. -->

<!-- 
### Rights Forms

You will find a link to the ACM copyright form on your paper's [HotCRP page](https://cheops25.hotcrp.com/).
Once completed, ACM will send out the information and LaTeX directives (DOI, ISBN etc.) needed to complete the camera-ready version of your paper.
-->

### Camera-Ready Format

You should use the `acmart` document class (<https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>, the same as for submission), as follows: `\documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart}`

As mentioned above, you will receive the instruction regarding some LaTeX directives (`\setcopyright`, `\acmConference`, `\acmDOI` etc.) after completing the copyright form.

All accepted papers can use up to 2 additional pages for the camera-ready version, for a final limit of 8 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) pages, references not included.

Note that Type 1 fonts (scalable) should be used, not Type 3 (bitmapped), and that all fonts must be embedded.
Type and embedding of fonts can be checked with various tools including `pdffonts`.
Page numbers should be suppressed.
Make also sure that the PDF is searchable by testing the search function in a PDF reader.

## Information regarding the Rights forms and Uploading Final versions is coming soon. 

<!-- 
### Uploading Final Versions

The camera-ready version of your paper and its LaTeX sources have to be uploaded via [HotCRP](https://cheops25.hotcrp.com/).
As a reminder, the camera-ready deadline for all papers is Feb 28th, 2025.

## Topics of Interest

Submissions may be more hands-on than research papers and we therefore explicitly encourage submissions in the early stages of research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Operating system optimizations
- Kernel and user space file/storage systems
  - Including virtual file systems
- Cloud, parallel and distributed file/storage systems
  - Network challenges, such as scalability, QoS and partitionability
- Approaches for low-latency and heterogeneous storage systems
  - Such as SCM and NVRAM combined with HDDs
- Metadata management
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
  - Storage requirements of ML and AI applications (including LLMs)
  - Using ML and AI within storage systems (e.g., to replace heuristics, to optimize storage and I/O systems)
- Hybrid solutions using file systems and databases
  - Approaches using query and database interfaces, including key-value stores
  - Optimized indexing techniques
- Data organizations to support online workflows
- Data privacy and data security
- Domain-specific data management solutions
  - Application I/O characterization
- Storage systems modeling and analysis tools
- Data reduction techniques
  - Lossless and lossy compression, deduplication, dimensionality reduction, surrogate modeling
- UI/UX for storage systems
- Related experiences from users: what worked, what didn't?
  - Feedback and empirical evaluation of storage systems

## WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP) SESSION

There will be a WIP session where presenters provide brief (5-minute) talks on their on-going work, with fresh problems/solutions. WIP will not be included in the proceedings. A one-page abstract is required.

DEADLINES

- Work in Progress (WIP) submissions due: Feb 21st, 2025
- Notification: Mar 1st, 2025

Submissions by email: Please email your submission as a PDF attachment of the one-page abstract to Amelie Chi Zhou (amelieczhou@hkbu.edu.hk) and Kira Duwe (kira.duwe@epfl.ch). Put “CHEOPS 2025 WIP” as the first part of the message subject.
