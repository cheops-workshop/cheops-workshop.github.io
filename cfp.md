# Workshop on Challenges and Opportunities of Efficient and Performant Storage Systems (CHEOPS)

The workshop is aimed at researchers, developers of scientific applications, engineers and everyone interested in the evolution of storage systems. As the developments of computing power, storage and network technologies continue to diverge, the bandwidth performance gap between them widens. This trend, combined with the ever growing data volumes and data-driven computing such as machine learning, results in I/O and storage limitations, impacting the scalability and efficiency of current and future computing systems. Some of these challenges are quantitative, such as scale to match exascale system requirements, or latency reduction of the software stack  to efficiently integrate new generations of hardware like storage class memory (SCM). Some other issues are more subtle and arise with the increased complexity of the storage solutions, like new smarter and more potent data management tools, monitoring systems or interoperability between I/O components or data formats.

## Important Dates

- Abstract Submission: January 15, 2022 (Anywhere on Earth)
- Paper Submission: January 22, 2022 (Anywhere on Earth)
- Notification to Authors: March 5, 2022
- Camera-Ready Deadline: March 19, 2022
- Workshop Date: April 5, 2022

## Submission Guidelines

Only original and novel work not currently under review in other venues will be considered for publication. Submissions can either be full papers (6 pages) or short papers (4 pages). The page count includes the title, text, figures, appendices but excludes the references. They must be submitted electronically as PDF files formatted according to the submission rules of EuroSys. Accepted submissions will have to comply with the EuroSys proceedings format. Extended versions of selected papers will be considered for publication in the ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review journal.

Papers have to be submitted to EasyChair at: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cheops21>
One author of each accepted paper is required to register for the workshop and present the paper.

## Topics of Interest

Submissions may be more hands-on than research papers and we therefore explicitly encourage submissions in the early stages of research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Operating system optimizations
- Kernel and user space file/storage systems
- Cloud, parallel and distributed file/storage systems
- Approaches for low-latency and heterogeneous storage systems
- Metadata management
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Hybrid solutions using file systems and databases
- Data organizations to support online workflows
- Domain-specific data management solutions
- Storage systems modeling and analysis tools
- Data reduction techniques
- UI/UX for storage systems
- Related experiences from users: what worked, what didn't?
