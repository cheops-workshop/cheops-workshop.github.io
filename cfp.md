# Workshop on Challenges and Opportunities of Efficient and Performant Storage Systems (CHEOPS)

The workshop is aimed at researchers, developers of scientific applications, engineers and everyone interested in the evolution of storage systems. As the developments of computing power, storage and network technologies continue to diverge, the bandwidth performance gap between them widens. This trend, combined with the ever growing data volumes and data-driven computing such as machine learning, results in I/O and storage limitations, impacting the scalability and efficiency of current and future computing systems. Some of these challenges are quantitative, such as scale to match Exascale system requirements, or latency reduction of the software stack  to efficiently integrate new generations of hardware like storage class memory (SCM). Some other issues are more subtle and arise with the increased complexity of the storage solutions, like new smarter and more potent data management tools, monitoring systems or interoperability between I/O components or data formats.

## Important Dates

- Abstract Submission: February 10, 2021 (Anywhere on Earth)
- Paper Submission: February 17, 2021 (Anywhere on Earth)
- Notification to Authors: March 22, 2021
- Camera-Ready Deadline: March 31, 2021
- Workshop Date: April 26, 2021

## Submission Guidelines

Only original and novel work not currently under review in other venues will be considered for publication. Submissions can either be full papers (8 pages) or short papers (4 pages). The page count includes the title, text, figures, appendices but excludes the references. They must be submitted electronically as PDF files formatted according to the submission rules of EuroSys available at: <https://2021.eurosys.org/cfp.html#cfp> Extended versions of selected papers will be considered for publication in the ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review journal.

One author of each accepted paper is required to register for the workshop and present the paper. Since the workshop will take place virtually, attendance will by done via video conferencing and a chat. Presentations have to be given either via pre-recorded video or live stream with a live Q&A session. More details will be published closer to the workshop.

Papers have to be submitted to EasyChair at: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cheops21>

## Topics of Interest

Submissions may be more hands-on than research papers and we therefore explicitly encourage submissions in the early stages of research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Operating system optimizations
- Kernel and user space file/storage systems
- Cloud, parallel and distributed file/storage systems
- Approaches for low-latency and heterogeneous storage systems
- Non-volatile memory technology and integration
- Metadata management
- Machine Learning and AI
- Hybrid solutions using file systems and databases
- Data organizations to support online workflows
- Domain-specific data management solutions
- Storage systems modeling and analysis tools
- Data reduction techniques such as compression and deduplication
- Security approaches for storage systems
- UI/UX for storage systems
- Related experiences from users: what worked, what didn't?
