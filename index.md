# Workshop on Challenges and Opportunities of Efficient and Performant Storage Systems (CHEOPS)

The first workshop on “Challenges and Opportunities of Efficient and Performant Storage Systems” (CHEOPS) is aimed at researchers, developers of scientific applications, engineers and everyone interested in the evolution of storage systems. As the developments of computing power, storage and network technologies continue to diverge, the bandwidth performance gap between them widens. This trend, combined with the ever growing data volumes and data-driven computing such as machine learning, results in I/O and storage limitations, impacting the scalability and efficiency of current and future computing systems. Some of these challenges are quantitative, such as scale to match Exascale system requirements, or latency reduction of the software stack  to efficiently integrate new generations of hardware like storage class memory (SCM). Some other issues are more subtle and arise with the increased complexity of the storage solutions, like new smarter and more potent data management tools, monitoring systems or interoperability between I/O components or data formats.

The main objective of this workshop is to present state-of-the-art research, innovative ideas and experiences that focus on the design and implementation of storage systems in both academic and industrial worlds.

## Important Dates

- Paper Submission: February 17, 2021
- Notification to Authors: March 22, 2021
- Camera-Ready Deadline: March 31, 2021
- Workshop Date: April 26, 2021

## Submission Guidelines

In order to guarantee the quality of the submissions, we have formed a globally distributed, diverse program committee. All submissions will be reviewed by the program committee. We will use [EasyChair to manage the submissions](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cheops21). The reviewing process will be double blind with at least 3 reviews for each submission. An online discussion will determine which papers to accept.

Only original and novel work not currently under review in other venues will be considered for publication. Full papers should not exceed 8 pages (including title, text, figures, appendices and references). They must be submitted electronically as PDF files formatted according to the [submission rules of EuroSys](https://2021.eurosys.org/cfp.html#cfp). Accepted submissions will have to comply with the EuroSys proceedings format. One author of each accepted paper is required to register for the workshop and present the paper.

Since the workshop will take place virtually, attendance will by done via video conferencing and a chat. Attendees can watch the workshop using a video conferencing solution such as Zoom or a video streaming solution such as YouTube. Questions can be asked via a chat system such as Slack. Presentations have to be given either via pre-recorded video or live stream. In both cases, the organizers will collect questions during the workshop and perform a live Q&A session with the presenter. More details will be published closer to the workshop.

## Topics of Interest

Submissions may be more hands-on than research papers and we therefore explicitly encourage submissions in the early stages of research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Operating system optimizations
- Kernel and user space file/storage systems
  - Including virtual file systems
- Cloud, parallel and distributed file/storage systems
  - Network challenges, such as scalability, QoS and partitionability
- Approaches for low-latency and heterogeneous storage systems
  - Such as SCM and NVRAM combined with HDDs
- Metadata management
- Machine Learning and AI
  - Storage requirements of ML and AI applications
  - Using ML and AI within storage systems (e.g., to replace heuristics)
- Hybrid solutions using file systems and databases
  - Approaches using query and database interfaces
  - Optimized indexing techniques
- Data organizations to support online workflows
- Domain-specific data management solutions
  - Application I/O characterization
- Storage systems modeling and analysis tools
- Data reduction techniques such as compression and deduplication
- UI/UX for storage systems
- Related experiences from users: what worked, what didn't?
  - Feedback and empirical evaluation of storage systems
