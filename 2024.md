### Keynote Speaker

#### Ana Klimovic, ETH Zurich

***Keynote: Data Management for Cost-Efficient Machine Learning***

##### Abstract

Training AI models is increasingly resource-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive as model sizes and datasets continue to grow. This talk will explore how to make training ML models more cost-effective from a data management and data preprocessing perspective.<br/>
First, we will discuss how to detect and eliminate input data processing bottlenecks that can occur in ML training and cause expensive GPU/TPU resources to be heavily underutilized. I will present Cachew, a disaggregated data preprocessing system architecture build on top of TensorFlow’s tf.data, which automatically scales resources for data processing to avoid input data stalls. Cachew also maintains a global view of data processing across jobs, which enables selectively caching preprocessed datasets to maximize training throughput and improve energy efficiency across jobs.<br/>
Second, we will discuss how to make ML training more data-efficient in practical deployments where training data evolves (e.g., grows) over time and models frequently need to be retrained.  Optimizing training costs for these applications requires optimizing how often a model is retrained and on how much data, while maintaining high accuracy. I will present Modyn, an open-source platform for ML training on dynamic datasets that enable researchers to explore a variety of retraining and data selection policies to minimize the cost required to reach a target model accuracy.

### Invited Speakers

#### Jay Lofstead, Sandia National Laboratories

***Invited Talk: HPC and databases revisited***

##### Abstract

Around twenty-five years ago, the HPC storage and IO community investigated the potential for relational databases for HPC data management and found numerous issues making an RDBMS a poor choice. SciDB made decisions as well that further cemented the difficulty in terms of ingestion velocity and overhead against an RDBMS mode for HPC data management. More recent work in the metadata arena, such as EMPRESS, and in a new IO library, Stitch-IO, show a potential path towards bringing these communities together. However, the challenges present offer potentially new research and a need to overcome well entrenched bias. This talk will explore the roots of this bias, why we should rethink, and propose a path towards data management bliss.

***Invited Talk: DAOS - The Next Generation***

##### Abstract

DAOS (https://daos.io/) is an open-source scale-out all-flash versioning object store that delivers extremely high performance to the most data-intensive HPC and AI workloads. It presents a rich and scalable storage interface that allows efficient storage of both structured and unstructured data. DAOS supports multiple application interfaces including a parallel filesystem, MPI-IO, HDF5, Hadoop/Spark connector, TensorFlow-IO, native Python dictionary bindings as well as domain-specific data models. While DAOS was originally based on Optane Persistent Memory, DAOS 2.4 now supports DAOS servers both with and without PMem. This presentation will highlight recent and upcoming technology developments in DAOS, and will explore how the DAOS Foundation (established in 2023 under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation) can facilitate further community contributions to DAOS.

***Invited Talk: Scaling Hybrid Parallel Training with Efficient and Reliable In-memory Checkpointing***

##### Abstract

Hybrid parallelism is a standard approach to train large models (LM) on large-scale GPU clusters. It usually takes tens of thousands of GPUs for a prolonged duration, accompanied by frequent hardware and software failures. Against such failures, asynchronous checkpointing is proposed to snapshot parameters from the device to host memory and persist in remote storage, ideally without disrupting the training process. However, our investigation reveals that such state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions impose GPU operation interference and cause large-scale GPUs to idle during parameter saving and loading, eventually increasing the carbon footprint and the financial cost of training. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work BurstCheck, a fault-tolerant distributed training framework with in-memory checkpoint design. It swiftly saves and loads checkpoints in local CPU memory with three optimizations: 1) Efficient in-memory checkpoint saving, 2) Reliable in-memory checkpoint protection, and 3) Accelerated failure recovery. We also propose a fast failure recovery scheme that enables training to swiftly and elastically restart from inter-node checkpoint gathering upon node failures, bypassing the inefficiencies of Network-File-System (NFS) read. On our 128 A800 GPU testbed, BurstCheck achieves SOTA parameter saving speed with minimum checkpointing overhead. It also guarantees the recovery of training from in-memory checkpoint in most failure circumstances.

#### Animesh Trivedi, VU Amsterdam

***Invited Talk: Exploring Storage Stack on Modern NVMe Hardware***

##### Abstract

We are living in a data-centric society where every aspect of our daily life is heavily influenced by data-centric services. As the volume and speed of data generation increase, so does demand on how efficiently data can be stored and processed. Over the past decade, the Linux storage stack has undergone significant restructuring to meet the performance demands of modern workloads, yet much research around new hardware and software interfaces remain to be explored. In this talk, I will summarize the most recent research results from my group on (i) the performance characterization of Linux I/O stack APIs with its newest API, io_uring, on modern fast NVMe SSDs (Systor’22, CHEOPS’23); (ii) exploration of quality-of-service and scheduling challenges with NVMe and newly Zone Namespace (ZNS) interfaces (CLUSTER'23, ICPE'24). The emergence and standardization of ZNS storage hardware have led to the revaluation of responsibilities between storage hardware (SSDs) and storage software, which we are actively exploring by designing novel storage services. Code and reports from our group are available at: <https://animeshtrivedi.github.io/team/> and <https://github.com/stonet-research>.

## Workshop Description

The CHEOPS workshop is aimed at researchers, developers of scientific applications, engineers and everyone interested in the evolution of storage systems. As the developments of computing power, storage and network technologies continue to diverge, the bandwidth performance gap between them widens. This trend, combined with the ever growing data volumes and data-driven computing such as machine learning, results in I/O and storage limitations, impacting the scalability and efficiency of current and future computing systems. Some of these challenges are quantitative, such as scale to match exascale system requirements, or latency reduction of the software stack  to efficiently integrate new generations of hardware like storage class memory (SCM). Some other issues are more subtle and arise with the increased complexity of the storage solutions, like new smarter and more potent data management tools, monitoring systems or interoperability between I/O components or data formats.

The main objective of this workshop is to discuss state-of-the-art research, innovative ideas and experiences that focus on the design and implementation of storage systems in both academic and industrial worlds.
